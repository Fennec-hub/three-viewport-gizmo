# Resizable Grid

<IframeContainer url="resizable-grid.html" />

This example shows ViewportGizmo integrated with a resizable grid, simulating its use in a mockup editor. The gizmo provides orientation feedback for camera movements within a grid-based layout, allowing users to navigate and align objects within a design space. The grid and gizmo adjust responsively as the editor is resized, ensuring smooth, intuitive interaction.
